# IPL Visualisation
<br>

## Overview
Found insights using Tableau on matches, players, and teams on an IPL dataset. The dataset consists of data from all IPL seasons between 2008 and 2017. Built three dashboards describing the match, player, and team statistics across all IPL seasons.

<br>

## Problem Statement
The Indian Premier League, or IPL, is a T20 cricket league, which was founded in 2008 and is held every year. It sees participation from both national and international players, and eight teams representing eight Indian cities compete with each other in a double round-robin format in the league stages, which are followed by playoffs. Over the years, IPL has become one of the most-watched and most attended live sporting events all over the world.

You work as a data analyst at IFP, a nationally recognised news agency, which is based out of New Delhi, and provides news reports and feeds to magazines, newspapers and TV broadcasters all over the country. The Sports Editor of the agency has approached you to build a Tableau dashboard of IPL statistics over the years since its inception in order to create an infographic for a newsletter that their team is working on. For this newsletter, in some cases, they will use the visual representations as you have created in Tableau directly for their infographic, and in a few other cases, they will use important statistics after trying out the different filters and customisations that you have provided for interactivity. Therefore, you are expected to build an interactive dashboard in Tableau for this purpose.

## Dataset description 
1. **matches.csv** 
   - It contains match-level information for each and every match held in IPL from 2008 to 2017.
   - Teams involved
   - Results (which team won, win type, player of the match, etc.)
   - Match specifics (umpires, ground, etc.)

2. **deliveries.csv** 
   - It contains ball-by-ball information for each of the matches.
   - Match related information (batting team vs bowling team)
   - Player information (Bowler, Batsman, Non-striker)
   - Delivery information (Runs scored, Wickets, Extras, etc.)
<br>


## Tasks
The final dashboard can be broken down into several categories and sub-categories. The ones which you need to focus on for this assignment are as follows:
1. **Match Statistics**
    - Toss outcome vs Match outcome (for each Ground/Venue)
    - Biggest wins (by runs and by wicket)
    - Highest totals (across all the seasons)


2. **Player Statistics**
    - Orange Cap contenders (The batsmen who have scored the maximum number of runs in a particular season)
    - Purple Cap contenders (The bowlers who have taken the maximum number of wickets in a particular season)
    - Batsmen who have hit the most number of fours and sixes (per season and overall)


3. **Team Statistics**
    - Season-wise team performance (wins vs losses)
    - Win %age (home vs away)
<br>

## Results Expected
- A tableau workbook containing 3 dashboards pertaining to the 3 categories - **Match statistics**, **Player statistics** and **Team statistics**.
- Each dashboard should contain the visualisations from the sub-category worksheets. For example, in the Match statistics dashboard, the visualisations should be from the Toss Outcome vs Match Outcome, Biggest Wins and Highest Totals worksheets. Similarly, you need to prepare the dashboards for Player statistics and Team statistics.
- The dashboards and the corresponding visualisations should be well-detailed.
- A PPT file containing the summary of the entire visual analysis for this assignment. This ppt should contain all the visualisations that have been used along with the necessary insights and details.
